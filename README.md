# Guard::Copy [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/marcisme/guard-copy.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/marcisme/guard-copy) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/marcisme/guard-copy)

Copy guard copies files to one or more locations whenever files are
created or modified.

* Tested against Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, and the latest versions of JRuby

## Installation

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)
installed.

Install the gem:

    $ gem install guard-copy

Add guard definition to your Guardfile by running this command:

    $ guard init copy

## Usage

Please read [Guard usage doc](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme)

## Guardfile

Copy guard can copy files from one source directory to one or more
target directories identified either explicitly or with wildcards.

### Single Target

``` ruby
guard :copy, :from => 'source', :to => 'target'
```

### Multiple Targets

``` ruby
guard :copy, :from => 'source', :to => ['t1', 't2']
```

### Newest Wildcard Target

``` ruby
guard :copy, :from => 'source', :to => 'target*', :glob => :newest
```

This guard will copy files from the source directory to the newest
directory starting with 'target'.

## Options

By default, Guard::Copy will copy modified and newly created files from
the directory specified by the `:from` option to that specified by the
`:to` option.

### List of available options:

``` ruby
:from    => 'source'   # directory to copy files from
:to      => 'target'   # directory or glob to copy files to; string or array
:glob    => :newest    # how to handle globs; default: :all
                       #   :newest - copy to only the newest directory
                       #   :all    - copy to all directories
:delete  => true       # delete files from target directories; default: false
:verbose => true       # log all operations as info messages; default: false
:absolute => true      # allow absolute paths for :to; default: false
```

## Watchers

The paths that files are ultimately copied to are generated by
substituting the `:from` portion of the changed file's path with each of
the `:to` directories. Because of this, any watchers you define will be
modified to be relative to the `:from` directory.

Therefore the following two watcher definitions are equivalent.

``` ruby
guard :copy, :from => 'source', :to => 'target' do
  watch(%r{^source/.+\.js$})
end
```

``` ruby
guard :copy, :from => 'source', :to => 'target' do
  watch(%r{^.+\.js$})
end
```
